## App Shell
- AppLayout.tsx — wraps all /app/* routes, loads Supabase data for shell
- AppSidebarRefined.tsx — navigation, branding from useProgramSettings()
- WorkflowTopBar.tsx — property switcher, date, notifications, user display

## Core Data Flow
Program Setup → Employees + Properties + Tasks + Shift Templates
→ Scheduler (shifts) → Workboard (assignments) → Field (clock events)
→ Reports (scheduled vs assigned vs actual hours)

## Key Business Rules
- Every data write scoped by org_id; property_id required where column is NOT NULL
- tasks.property_id is nullable — tasks can be org-wide (not tied to a property)
- Admins and managers can write to all tables in their org
- Field crew (employee role) can only read their own data
- Property switcher in top bar scopes all page queries
- Today's date is the default for all operational pages

## What Each Page Owns
- Dashboard: reads schedule_entries + assignments + equipment_units (today)
- Workboard: reads + writes assignments, reads schedule_entries + tasks + employees
- Scheduler: reads + writes schedule_entries, reads employees
- Field: reads assignments + schedule_entries, writes clock_events
- Reports: reads all four: schedule_entries + assignments + clock_events + employees

## Known Working Patterns
- dataStore is DEAD — never import from @/lib/dataStore
- All data from supabase-queries.ts hooks
- Auth from useAuth() — never from localStorage directly
- Pending clock events: localStorage key 'gcrew-pending-clocks'

## Self-Service Onboarding Flow
New clients complete setup through the app — no developer help:
1. Register — org created automatically in organizations table
2. Dashboard shows onboarding checklist (6 steps)
3. Weather setup via /app/weather onboarding flow
4. Employees added via /app/employees
5. Equipment added via /app/equipment
6. Tasks added via /app/settings (task catalog)
7. Shifts scheduled via /app/scheduler
8. Assignments built via /app/workboard

## Weather Self-Service Pattern
weather_locations and weather_stations are ALWAYS created
by the user through the weather onboarding flow.
Never hardcode lat/lng or insert weather rows in migrations.
The geocoding flow uses:
  https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search

## Feature Flag Pattern
Enabled modules are stored in program_settings.enabledModules[]
Check before rendering any module nav item:
  const isEnabled = programSetting?.enabledModules?.includes('weather')
